>> Heuristic: generate credits from (most recent credit month/year + 1) thru (current month/year)
              for each month/year, date will have day = 1 (e.g., 12/1/2018)


-- Ensure that interest credit is based on balance as of interest credit date
Given today is 2/28/2019
And a deposit of $100 was made on 12/1/2018
And another deposit of $200 was made on 1/15/2019
When we request balance
Then we add interest credits of 1/1/2018 (bal=$100.00->21c), 2/1/2018 (bal=$300.21->63c)

-- Test for including interest credit in balance

Test: monthsWithoutCreditsShouldFillInCreditsRetroactively
-- Multiple Retroactive Credit + Crossing Year Boundary
Given today is 2/28/2019
And last interest credit was on 11/1/2018
When we request balance today (2/28/2019)
Then we add interest credits for 12/1/2018, 1/1/2019, 2/1/2019

Test: retroactiveCreditShouldOnlyBeCreatedAsOfFirstAccountTransaction
-- Retroactive, where no other interest credit transactions have occurred
Given today is 2/2/2019
And first (and only) transaction was a DEPOSIT on 1/31/2019 (no interest credit)
When we request balance
Then we should have interest credit for 2/1/2019

Test: retroactiveCreditShouldOnlyBeCreatedAsOfFirstAccountTransaction
-- Retroactive credit, no previous credits
Given today is 3/10/2019
And account balance is $100
And first transaction was 2/3/2019
And no interest was ever credited (0 interest credited transactions)
When we request balance (on 3/10/2019)
Then we add credit ONLY for 3/1/2019

Test: interestShouldOnlyBeDepositedOnceForCurrentMonth
Given today is 2/1/2017
And account balance is $100
And last interest credit was on 2/1/2017
When we request balance
Then we don't add any credit

Test: missingOneMonthCreditShouldAddOneMonthCreditEvenIfTodayIsNotTheFirstDayOfMonth
Given today is 2/27/2019
And last interest credit was on 1/1/2019
When we request balance on 2/27/2019
Then we add credit ONLY for 2/1/2019 (1 + 1 = 2 thru 2): {2}

Test: missingOneMonthCreditShouldAddOneMonthCredit
Given today 2/1/2019 (current-month-year = 2/2019)
And last interest credit was on 1/1/2019 (most-recent-credit-month-year = 1/2019)
When we request balance (on 2/1/2019)
Then we add credit ONLY for 2/1/2019 (1 + 1 thru 2)
